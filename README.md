# Image Processing

This repository is a list of links to and files from my previous projects on image processing

## [Simplify](https://github.com/EgeEken/Simplify)

Simplifies a given image into a black over white version of it that resembles a sketch.

## [Simplify Color](https://github.com/EgeEken/Simplify-Color)

Simplifies a given images colors by reducing the amount of uniquely colored of pixels in it.

## [Fill Object](https://github.com/EgeEken/Fill-Object)

Fills any closed "objects" in a black over white image.

## [Detect Object](https://github.com/EgeEken/Detect-Object)

Detects the object in an image and crops out the rest

## [Submerge](https://github.com/EgeEken/Submerge)

Submerges an area of land based on the given topographical data and satellite image

(This one isn't exactly "image processing" like the other ones but i relied heavily on analyzing the colors from the topographical map images because i couldn't extract the data directly from the website i was using. And this school project was what inspired me to work on these other image processing projects so i thought it would be fitting to include it here)
